# Python "data science"

Develop two Python functions:

## `get_data()`
_accepts_: a file path (string) and

_outputs_: a list of lists of integers.

The file will contain two lines of integers separated by spaces, for example:

```text
1 44 31 4 5 6
21 3 2 13 55 72
```

## `analyze_data()`
_accepts_:
1. a list of lists of integers and
2. a string option that can be one of the following:
    * `"average"` (of all the data together)
    * `"standard deviation"` (of all the data together)
    * `"covariance"` (between the two lists)
    * `"correlation"` ([Pearson's correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient))
and

_outputs_: a floating-point number.

For the above example, your results should be about 21.4, 22.9, -257, and -0.594, respectively.

## constraints
* You must submit your work in the form of a GitHub repository.
  1. Invite the GitHub user `patrickkwang` to collaborate on your repository.
  2. Include a link to the repository in the text of your Sakai submission.
* You must work in group of 2 or 3 (not alone - we're practicing collaboration). We expect to see commits from each student, though you're welcome to pair-program as well.
* You may `import math`, but no other packages, standard or otherwise.
